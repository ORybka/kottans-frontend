 Thanks to [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) course I felt myself a superhero. 
 Before I was using max 5 git commands and never truly understand the real possibilities of this system.
 Moreover, I perceived it more like magic. :sparkles: 
 For now, I have a real picture of how it works, what I can do there and how it can help me with my projects.

 ### Version Control with Git :heavy_check_mark:

 ### Summary :smile_cat:
 :zap: **Things that were new to me**
 * Finally I learnt **the main definitions** of Git and I can draw in my mind where and how all the code goes;
 * `$ git log` - list of commits (!don't forget to end with Q);
 * file **.gitignore** - perfect way to list the files you don't them to be your repo;
 * `$ git tag -a` - add tags to specific commits;
 * As I am working alone now I've never faced branching and merging topics. I liked these the most. Very powerful tools, can't wait to use them for real.
   * `$ git branch <branchName>`- to create a new branch;
   * `$ git checkout <branchName>` - to switch to a specific branch;
   * `$ git checkout -b <branchName>` - to create a new branch and simultaneously switch to it;
   * `$ git rebase`- to copy commits from one branch to another;
   * `$ git merge <branchName>` - to merge a specific branch into the one where you are now;
   * **Resolving a merge conflict** - it's quite simple to do (as for now, when it's not a big project I guess :sweat_smile:);
 * Commands to change/delete your commits:
   * `$ git commit --amend` - change the last commit;
   * `$ git revert <SHA>` - revert a specific commit;
   * `$ git reset` - can be `--mixed`(by default), `--soft` and `--hard` (be CAREFUL);
 * New commands related to the remote repo, such as:
   * `$ git fetch`
   * `$ git fakeTeamwork` 
 * Related commit references (was not that easy to get it but I did it :D)

 :zap: **Things that surprised me**
 Never used such an impostant and so informative command as `$ git log`. 
 Of course I liked the most `$ git log --oneline`. Little time to scroll and you have everything you need.

 :zap: **Things I intend to use in the future**
 I am already and will in the future use `$ git log` command as well as all the commands related to the branching and merging.
 Can't wait to see how it all works in a real project.
