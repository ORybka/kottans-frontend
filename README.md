 Thanks to [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) course I felt myself a superhero. 
 Before I was using max 5 git commands and never truly understand the real possibilities of this system.
 Moreover, I perceived it more like magic. :sparkles: 
 For now, I have a real picture of how it works, what I can do there and how it can help me with my projects.

 ### Version Control with Git :heavy_check_mark:

 ### Summary :smile_cat:
 :zap: **Things that were new to me**
 * Finally I learnt **the main definitions** of Git and I can draw in my mind where and how all the code goes;
 * `$ git log` - list of commits (!don't forget to end with Q);
 * file **.gitignore** - perfect way to list the files you don't them to be your repo;
 * `$ git tag -a` - add tags to specific commits;
 * As I am working alone now I've never faced branching and merging topics. I liked these the most. Very powerful tools, can't wait to use them for real.
   * `$ git branch <branchName>`- to create a new branch;
   * `$ git checkout <branchName>` - to switch to a specific branch;
   * `$ git checkout -b <branchName>` - to create a new branch and simultaneously switch to it;
   * `$ git rebase`- to copy commits from one branch to another;
   * `$ git merge <branchName>` - to merge a specific branch into the one where you are now;
   * **Resolving a merge conflict** - it's quite simple to do (as for now, when it's not a big project I guess :sweat_smile:);
 * Commands to change/delete your commits:
   * `$ git commit --amend` - change the last commit;
   * `$ git revert <SHA>` - revert a specific commit;
   * `$ git reset` - can be `--mixed`(by default), `--soft` and `--hard` (be CAREFUL);
 * New commands related to the remote repo, such as:
   * `$ git fetch`
   * `$ git fakeTeamwork` 
 * Related commit references (was not that easy to get it but I did it :D)

 :zap: **Things that surprised me**
 Never used such an impostant and so informative command as `$ git log`. 
 Of course I liked the most `$ git log --oneline`. Little time to scroll and you have everything you need.

 :zap: **Things I intend to use in the future**
 I am already and will in the future use `$ git log` command as well as all the commands related to the branching and merging.
 I foutd very useful command `$ git log --oneline --graph --all`.
 Can't wait to see how it all works in a real project.

 ## :point_right: <a name="linux-cli-http">Linux CLI and HTTP</a>

 This section was informative for me, especially when it comes to networking topic, which was quite difficult to get (I tried to start reading the article for more than 5 times and ended up watching youtube videos and asking my brother for help :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile:). But I totally agree that I had to go through this.
 I've already known most of the commands from Linux topic, but some of them will fill up my notes.

 ### Linux Survival (4 modules) :heavy_check_mark:

 ### Summary :smile_cat:
 :zap: **Things that were new to me**
 * Linux CLI
   * `$ mv` - didn't no that you can use it for renaming;
   * `$ pwd` to print your working directory;
   * totally new staff about security and a command `$ chmod` to change those settings;
   * `$ man` to open the manual and find out about a command needed;
   * `$ find` - great command to find files by name, date, owner etc;
   * `$ cat` - to combine files;
   * commands related to a printer;
   * `$ df` (disk free) - how much space you have;
   * `$ ps aux` (process status) - to manage process that  are already running on your computer;
   * `$ grep` - to find words in files and much more.
 * HTTP

 :zap: **Things that surprised me**
 ...
 
 :zap: **Things I intend to use in the future**
 * Linux CLI - I think I will use most of the commands, esoecially those which stand for the manipulation with files and directories.
 * HTTP -
